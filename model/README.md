# Model

Everything in this directory has been auto-generated from `api/openapi.yaml`.
This includes the:

- types (the models themselves)
- server
- the clients (which I don't use at the moment)

The naming isn't perfect. Ideally it'd be nice to split these up into different
packages, but I think the server relies on the types being in the same package.
